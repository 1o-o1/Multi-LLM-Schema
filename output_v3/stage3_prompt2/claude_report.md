I'll conduct a comprehensive security analysis of Windows Authentication Logs by researching the current threat landscape, adversary behaviors, and detection opportunities. Let me start by gathering the latest threat intelligence.Now I have gathered comprehensive information about the current threat landscape, lateral movement techniques, credential dumping attacks, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and STIX 2.1 standards. Let me compile this into a complete security analysis report for Windows Authentication Logs.

# Security Analysis Report for Windows Authentication Logs

## Executive Summary

Windows Authentication Logs represent one of the most critical data sources for detecting advanced persistent threats, lateral movement, and credential-based attacks in enterprise environments. According to the CrowdStrike 2025 Global Threat Report, the misuse of valid accounts emerged as the primary initial access vector for cloud environments, accounting for 35% of cloud incidents in the first half of 2024. Adversaries also used compromised credentials to enter and move laterally through organizations, operating as legitimate users and evading detections, with access broker advertisements, often selling valid stolen credentials, surging 50% year-over-year.

This log source provides unparalleled visibility into authentication patterns, enabling detection of sophisticated attack techniques including pass-the-hash attacks, credential dumping, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. The analyzed fields—encompassing source/destination computers, authentication types, logon types, timestamps, user accounts, orientations, and statuses—form a comprehensive framework for identifying malicious activity that traditional perimeter defenses often miss.

Key recommendations include implementing behavioral analytics for anomaly detection, establishing baseline authentication patterns, monitoring for temporal and geographical inconsistencies, and integrating authentication logs with threat intelligence platforms for enhanced context and attribution.

## 1. Threat Landscape & Adversary Behavior

### 1.1. Current Threat Landscape Research

**Industry Reporting:**

Voice phishing (vishing) attacks surged by 442% between the first and second half of 2024 as groups like CURLY SPIDER trick employees into handing over login details. Those who don't steal credentials can buy them — access broker activity was up nearly 50% in 2024, reflecting the growing market for illicit access. The average eCrime breakout time — the time it takes for an adversary to move from an initially compromised host to another within the target organization — was 48 minutes in 2024, down from 62 minutes the previous year.

Valid account abuse is the primary initial access tactic, accounting for 35% of cloud incidents in H1 2024. According to M-Trends 2025, the most common initial infection vector was exploit (33%), followed by stolen credentials (16%), and email phishing (14%). While exploits are still the most common way that attackers are breaching organizations, they're using stolen credentials more than ever before.

**Emerging Vectors:**

LockBit leverages a wide array of tools for lateral movement, including Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, and RDP. They're also known to use custom tools to disable security software. In February 2024, the BlackCat ransomware group infiltrated Change Healthcare's systems, utilizing stolen credentials to move laterally across the network. They deployed ransomware to encrypt files and exfiltrated sensitive data to pressure the organization into paying a ransom.

The vulnerability enables what is known as an authentication coercion attack, where a vulnerable device is essentially coerced into sending NTLM hashes — the cryptographic representation of a user's password — to an attacker's system.

**Academic Research:**

Recent research proposed a different set of rarity aspects to characterize an anomalous Windows authentication event, with systems tracking login activity and creating graphs of related logins among hosts to identify anomalies in login patterns, thus allowing for detecting lateral movement attacks. Anomaly detection is crucial for various applications, including network security, fraud detection, predictive maintenance, fault diagnosis, and industrial and healthcare monitoring. Many researchers have proposed numerous methods and worked in the area of anomaly detection.

### 1.2. MITRE ATT&CK® Framework Mapping

**T1003 – OS Credential Dumping:**
Adversaries may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password. Credentials can be obtained from OS caches, memory, or structures. Credentials can then be used to perform Lateral Movement and access restricted information. Detection relies on monitoring authentication events in the `destination_users` and `source_users` fields for unusual credential usage patterns.

**T1021 – Remote Services:**
Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to log into a service that accepts remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and VNC. Domains provide centralized identity management, allowing users to login using one set of credentials across the entire network. If an adversary is able to obtain a set of valid domain credentials, they could login to many different machines using remote access protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP). Observable through `auth_type`, `logon_type`, `source_computer`, and `destination_computer` fields.

**T1078 – Valid Accounts:**
Leverages legitimate credentials for persistence and lateral movement. Detectable through analysis of `source_users`, `destination_users`, `times`, and `statuses` fields for anomalous authentication patterns.

**TA0008 – Lateral Movement:**
Lateral Movement consists of techniques that adversaries use to enter and control remote systems on a network. Following through on their primary objective often requires exploring the network to find their target and subsequently gaining access to it. All analyzed fields contribute to lateral movement detection, particularly `source_computer`, `destination_computer`, and temporal patterns in `times`.

## 2. Observable Evidence & Patterns 

### 2.1.1 Malicious Behavioral/Temporal Patterns

**Pattern:** Rapid Cross-System Authentication

**Identifiable Fields:** `source_computer`, `destination_computer`, `times`, `source_users`, `destination_users`, `logon_type`

**Pattern:** Pass-the-Hash Authentication Anomalies
**Description:** Attackers leverage hashed credentials (NTLM hashes) or Kerberos tickets to authenticate on other systems without needing the plaintext passwords. These techniques are commonly used to escalate privileges and move laterally between high-value systems
**Identifiable Fields:** `auth_type`, `destination_users`, `source_computer`, `destination_computer`, `statuses`

**Pattern:** Privilege Escalation Authentication Chains
**Description:** Sequential authentication events showing escalation from standard user to administrative accounts across systems.
**Identifiable Fields:** `source_users`, `destination_users`, `times`, `orientations`, `statuses`

**Pattern:** Credential Stuffing Attack Signatures
**Description:** Malicious actors routinely use the NTLM authentication protocol to carry out account enumeration and brute force-styled attacks to compromise accounts within a victim's network. Once inside, an attacker can gain persistence, exfiltrate sensitive data, and unleash ransomware
**Identifiable Fields:** `source_users`, `destination_users`, `statuses`, `times`, `auth_type`

**Pattern:** Service Account Abuse
**Description:** Legitimate service accounts being used for interactive logons or accessing resources outside their normal scope.
**Identifiable Fields:** `source_users`, `destination_users`, `logon_type`, `destination_computer`

### 2.1.2 Anomalous Behavioral/Temporal Patterns

**Pattern:** Off-Hours Authentication Activity
**Description:** User anomaly refers to the exercise of finding rare login pattern. Each device has a steady pattern of login as most of the IT operations are repetitive and so their login pattern is quite straight forward
**Identifiable Fields:** `times`, `source_users`, `destination_users`, `source_computer`

**Pattern:** Geographical Authentication Inconsistencies
**Description:** Authentication attempts from locations inconsistent with user's typical access patterns.
**Identifiable Fields:** `source_computer`, `times`, `source_users`, `destination_users`

**Pattern:** Authentication Protocol Deviations
**Description:** Users suddenly switching from typical Kerberos to NTLM authentication or other protocol changes.
**Identifiable Fields:** `auth_type`, `source_users`, `destination_users`, `times`

**Pattern:** Logon Type Anomalies
**Description:** Users performing logon types inconsistent with their role (e.g., service logons from interactive users).
**Identifiable Fields:** `logon_type`, `source_users`, `destination_users`, `destination_computer`

**Pattern:** Authentication Frequency Spikes
**Description:** Sudden increases in authentication frequency from specific users or to specific systems.
**Identifiable Fields:** `times`, `source_users`, `destination_users`, `source_computer`, `destination_computer`

### 2.1.3 Vulnerable Behavioral/Temporal Patterns

**Pattern:** Weak Authentication Protocol Usage
**Description:** Despite being replaced by more secure authentication protocols and having multiple known vulnerabilities, NTLM is still widely deployed today because of its compatibility with legacy systems and applications
**Identifiable Fields:** `auth_type`, `source_computer`, `destination_computer`

**Pattern:** Shared Account Usage
**Description:** Multiple simultaneous sessions from the same account across different systems.
**Identifiable Fields:** `source_users`, `destination_users`, `times`, `source_computer`, `destination_computer`

**Pattern:** Stale Authentication Sessions
**Description:** Long-running authentication sessions without re-authentication, indicating potential session hijacking vulnerability.
**Identifiable Fields:** `times`, `orientations`, `source_users`, `destination_users`

**Pattern:** Administrative Account Overuse
**Description:** Administrative accounts being used for routine tasks instead of standard user accounts.
**Identifiable Fields:** `source_users`, `destination_users`, `logon_type`, `destination_computer`

**Pattern:** Legacy System Authentication
**Description:** Authentication to systems running outdated software or protocols vulnerable to exploitation.
**Identifiable Fields:** `destination_computer`, `auth_type`, `source_users`, `destination_users`

### 2.2. Key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

**Authentication Failure Patterns:** The most common and noisy indicators within event logs for lateral movement attempts are failed logins; the most common event IDs for this are 529 & 4625. Each method of lateral movement has its own set of associated event IDs. For example, attempts to login to accounts via SMB will generate event IDs 552 or 4648 (logon attempt using explicit credentials), and PsExec will show 601 or 4697 (service was installed in the system)

**Credential Dumping Artifacts:** LSASS credential dumping was first observed in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of several sophisticated threat activity groups—including actors that Microsoft tracks as HAFNIUM and GALLIUM. Detecting and stopping OS credential theft is therefore important because it can spell the difference between compromising or encrypting one device versus an entire network

**Lateral Movement Indicators:** Based on searches, administrators connected over the network from specific IP addresses and gained command line access to victim hosts. Using psexec for lateral movement has been around for quite a while and is still very popular and relevant

**Account Enumeration Signatures:** Account enumeration is a more specific type of brute force attack where the attacker is attempting to guess the valid usernames of users within a network. These attacks are typically done when the malicious actor has limited information about their victim's network
